# Several-ML-try-out-for-classification-in-python

Problem is to classify whether user will be converted to potential lead for online website delivering training.Given several features captured 
from the website to work on .

Have used Logistic regression,SVM,Decision tree , Naive Bayes,KNN,perceptron to check which ML algorithm shows better result.
